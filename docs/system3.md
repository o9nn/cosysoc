# System 3: The Four Relations

## Overview

System 3 concerns the relationship of two sets of three centers to a common periphery. There are exactly four possible ways that three centers can relate to one another within a term, creating four "Relation terms."

## The Four Relations

### Relation 1: Discretion Term
Three centers in timelike succession from center to periphery. Each center acts like a dam or sieve that partitions energies conforming to a certain quality of active intensity.

**Characteristics:**
- Universal, open and unbounded
- Expressive mode
- Represents: Idea → Routine → Formation

### Relation 2: Means Term
The subjective or regenerative mode of the discretion term. Two relational wholes (R₁ and R₂) portray two identities that eclipse Center 2 between them.

**Characteristics:**
- Center 2 acts as a perceptual axis to a double identity
- Countercurrent identities sustain the means of activity
- Regenerative mode

### Relation 3: Goal Term
The complete reconciliation of center and periphery. Two centers are coalesced as one within the remaining center.

**Characteristics:**
- Simultaneous perception of center and periphery
- Neither internal nor external, but both at once
- Eternal quality
- Represents quantization of energy and units of memory

### Relation 4: Consequence Term
Three mutually independent yet related centers. Each center is spatially closed with surfaces.

**Characteristics:**
- Spacelike quality (vs. timelike in Relation 1)
- Triangular configuration
- Foundation for tetrahedral structure in higher systems

## Mathematical Description

```
System 3: S₃ = {C₁, C₂, C₃, C₄} → {T₁, T₂, T₃, T₄}
- Four centers
- Four terms (Relations)
- Two orthogonal dyadic pairs
```

The four terms map to:
- **Discretion (D)** - Relation 1
- **Means (M)** - Relation 2
- **Goals (P)** - Relation 3
- **Consequence (O)** - Relation 4

## Summary Table

| Relation | Term Name | Character | Mode | Key Feature |
|----------|-----------|-----------|------|-------------|
| 1 | Discretion | Timelike succession | Expressive | Idea → Routine → Formation |
| 2 | Means | Regenerative | Subjective | Countercurrent identities |
| 3 | Goal | Reconciliation | Eternal | Quantization of energy/memory |
| 4 | Consequence | Independent wholes | Spacelike | Triangular configuration |
