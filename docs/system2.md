# System 2: Perceptive Wholeness

## Overview

System 2 introduces duality into the framework - two centers forming a single "term" called perceptive wholeness. This is the first differentiation from the unity of System 1.

## Key Characteristics

System 2 defines two modes to a term - **subjective** and **objective**. The two centers are distinct from one another (one inside the other), with a sequence or succession to interface processes at each center.

## Geometric Representation

### From Darkness View
- Concentric structure showing:
  - L₀ (Pure Light) - innermost
  - L₁ (Graduated Light)
  - Center 2
  - Center 1
  - D (Darkness)
  - Unbounded - outermost

### From Light View
- Two centers (①, ②) connected along the axis
- L₀ → L₁ → D progression
- Shows timelike succession between centers

## Mathematical Description

```
System 2: S₂ = {C₁, C₂} → T₁
- Two centers (C₁, C₂)
- One term (T₁): Perceptive Wholeness
- Introduces subjective/objective polarity
```

The state transition can be represented as:
```
C₁ (subjective) ↔ C₂ (objective)
```

## The Emergence of Duality

System 2 represents the fundamental split that enables perception:
- **Subjective pole**: The perceiver, the inner center
- **Objective pole**: The perceived, the outer center
- **Term**: The relationship between them (perceptive wholeness)

This duality is the foundation for all subsequent complexity in higher systems.

## Relationship to Other Systems

- **From System 1**: Emerges as differentiation of the single center
- **To System 3**: Provides the dyadic foundation for triadic relations

## Applications

In practical applications, System 2 represents:
- **Neural**: Perception-action coupling
- **Organizational**: Internal operations vs. external market
- **Cellular**: Nucleus-cytoplasm relationship
- **Consciousness**: Subject-object distinction
