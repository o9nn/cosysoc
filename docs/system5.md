# System 5: Tetrahedral Integration

## Overview

System 5 extends the enneagram structure of System 4 into a three-dimensional tetrahedral framework. It represents the integration of 18 services organized into the [[D-T]-[P-O]-[S-M]] pattern.

## Key Characteristics

System 5 is characterized by:
- **18 terms/services** organized into triads
- **4 tensor bundles** (tetrahedral vertices)
- **6 dyadic edges** shared between bundles
- **3 concurrent consciousness threads**

## The Tetrahedral Structure

The tetrahedron provides the geometric foundation:
- **4 vertices**: Representing 4 monadic threads
- **6 edges**: Representing 6 dyadic relationships
- **4 faces**: Representing 4 triadic fiber bundles

Each triadic face contains 3 of the 4 threads, forming complementary sets.

## The [[D-T]-[P-O]-[S-M]] Pattern

The 18 services are organized into three polarities:

### Polarity 1: [D-T] Discretion-Treasury
- **D (Discretion)**: Hierarchical direction and policy
- **T (Treasury)**: Resource allocation and financial management

### Polarity 2: [P-O] Product-Organization
- **P (Product/Goals)**: Development and market objectives
- **O (Organization)**: Structure and operational processes

### Polarity 3: [S-M] Sales-Means
- **S (Sales)**: Market interface and transactions
- **M (Means)**: Regenerative support and maintenance

## Mathematical Description

```
System 5: S₅ = {18 services in [[D-T]-[P-O]-[S-M]] pattern}
- 4 tensor bundles (tetrahedron vertices)
- 6 dyadic edges (tetrahedron edges)
- 4 triadic faces (tetrahedron faces)
- 3 concurrent threads (120° phase separation)
```

## Relationship to OEIS A000081

The nested shell structure follows the sequence of rooted trees:
- 1 nest → 1 term (System 1)
- 2 nests → 2 terms (System 2)
- 3 nests → 4 terms (System 3)
- 4 nests → 9 terms (System 4)
- 5 nests → 18+ terms (System 5)

## The 12-Step Cognitive Loop

System 5 operates through a 12-step cycle with 3 concurrent streams:
- Streams phased 4 steps apart (120°)
- Steps grouped into triads: {1,5,9}, {2,6,10}, {3,7,11}, {4,8,12}
- 7 expressive steps + 5 reflective steps

## Applications

System 5 has been applied to:
- **cosys-xnn**: Neural networks and brain regions
- **cosys-org**: Business organizations
- **cosys-esn**: Echo state networks
- **cosys-cell**: Cellular biology
- **cosys-skin**: Integumentary system
