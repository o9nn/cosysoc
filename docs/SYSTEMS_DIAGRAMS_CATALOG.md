This document catalogs the key diagrams from Bob Campbell's "Fisherman's Guide: A Systems Approach to Creativity and Organization" that form the foundation of the Cosmos System framework.

## Figure 17 - System 1: Center/Whole Designation (Page 107)

**Description:** Shows two complementary perspectives for designating a center or whole:

### Designation from Darkness (Passive/Subjective)
- Concentric circles representing:
  - Center, Whole (innermost)
  - Light
  - Darkness
  - Unbounded (outermost)

### Designation from Light (Active/Objective)
- Linear representation showing:
  - L in L (Light in Light)
  - L in D (Light in Darkness)
  - Center or Whole at the intersection
  - "Dark Side Opens to Darkness"
  - Active Interface

**Key Concept:** System 1 represents universal wholeness - everything manifests as a whole within universal wholeness through an unbounded active interface between an absolute center and an absolute periphery. Everything communicates with sky.

## Figure 18 - System 2: Two Centers/Terms (Page 111)

**Description:** Shows the emergence of two centers forming a "term" (perceptive wholeness):

### From Darkness View
- Concentric structure showing:
  - L₀ (Pure Light)
  - L₁ (Graduated Light)
  - Center 2
  - Center 1
  - D (Darkness)
  - Unbounded

### From Light View
- Two centers (①, ②) connected along the axis:
  - L₀ → L₁ → D
- Shows timelike succession between centers

**Key Concept:** System 2 defines two modes to a term - subjective and objective. The two centers are distinct from one another (one inside the other), with a sequence or succession to interface processes at each center.

## System Progression Summary

| System | Centers | Terms | Key Concept |
|--------|---------|-------|-------------|
| 1 | 1 | - | Universal wholeness, unity with sky |
| 2 | 2 | 1 | Perceptive wholeness, subjective/objective modes |
| 3 | 4 | 2 | Relation (to be documented) |
| 4 | 9 | 4 | Primary creative process (to be documented) |

## System 3: The Four Relations (Pages 123-127)

System 3 concerns the relationship of two sets of three centers to a common periphery. There are exactly four possible ways that three centers can relate to one another within a term, creating four "Relation terms."

### Figure 21 - Relation 1: The Discretion Term (Page 123)

This diagram shows three centers in timelike succession from center to periphery. Each center acts like a dam or sieve that partitions energies conforming to a certain quality of active intensity. The term is universal, open and unbounded.

The three successive interfaces represent: Idea → Routine → Formation

### Figure 22 - Relation 2: The Means Term (Page 124)

This diagram shows the subjective or regenerative mode of the discretion term. Two relational wholes (R₁ and R₂) portray two identities that eclipse Center 2 between them. Center 2 acts like a perceptual axis to a double identity - one subjective and one objective. Expended energies are regenerated through countercurrent identities to sustain the means of activity.

### Figure 23 - Relation 3: The Goal Term (Page 125)

This diagram portrays the complete reconciliation of center and periphery. Two centers are coalesced as one within the remaining center. Each of the coalesced centers sees inside the other only to see outside through their common periphery. There is simultaneous perception of center and periphery within the term - neither internal nor external, but both at once. It is eternal.

### Figure 24 - Relation 4: The Consequence Term (Page 126)

This diagram shows three mutually independent yet related centers. Three centers cannot exist independently in a common sky unless each is spatially closed. Centers become enclosed with surfaces, distinguishing them as specific independent wholes with a spacelike quality. Each particular whole is intimately related to two partners through objective perception of double identity, uniting them into a single composite whole.
