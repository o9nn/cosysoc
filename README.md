# Cosmos System of Consciousness (cosysoc)

A systematic reconstruction of Robert Campbell's Systems 1-5 framework from "Fisherman's Guide: A Systems Approach to Creativity and Organization" (1985), with modern visualizations, mathematical formulations, and interactive animations.

## Overview

This repository preserves and extends the work of **Robert Campbell (1936-2021)**, who developed a comprehensive systems theory that bridges subjective experience and objective organization. The framework describes how consciousness and creativity emerge through a staged development process from unity (System 1) to complex creative processes (System 4 and beyond).

## The Systems Framework

| System | Centers | Terms | Key Concept | Geometric Form |
|--------|---------|-------|-------------|----------------|
| **1** | 1 | — | Universal wholeness, unity with sky | Point/Circle |
| **2** | 2 | 1 | Perceptive wholeness, subjective/objective modes | Line/Dyad |
| **3** | 4 | 4 | Four Relations: Discretion, Means, Goal, Consequence | Triangle/Triad |
| **4** | 9 | 9 | Primary creative process, enneagram transformations | Enneagram |
| **5** | 18 | 18 | Tetrahedral system with [[D-T]-[P-O]-[S-M]] pattern | Tetrahedron |

## Key Concepts

### System 1: Universal Wholeness
The ground state representing the relationship of all things to indeterminate sky. Everything manifests as a whole within universal wholeness through an unbounded active interface between an absolute center and an absolute periphery.

### System 2: Perceptive Wholeness
Two centers define two modes (subjective and objective) related together as a "term" called perceptive wholeness. This introduces the fundamental duality that underlies all subsequent systems.

### System 3: Four Relations
Four possible ways that three centers can relate to one another:
1. **Discretion** (Relation 1): Timelike succession - Idea → Routine → Formation
2. **Means** (Relation 2): Regenerative mode with countercurrent identities
3. **Goal** (Relation 3): Complete reconciliation of center and periphery
4. **Consequence** (Relation 4): Three mutually independent yet related centers

### System 4: Primary Creative Process
Nine terms generated from five sets of four energy interfaces, represented by the enneagram. The transformation pattern follows:
- Particular sets take alternate steps to see themselves in the mirror
- Universal sets take double steps to flip themselves round with the mirror

### System 5: Tetrahedral Integration
A tetradic system of 4 tensor bundles, each containing a triadic system of 3 dyadic edges. The [[D-T]-[P-O]-[S-M]] pattern represents 18 services organized into triads.

## Mathematical Formulations

The systems can be described mathematically through:
- **Nested shells**: Following OEIS A000081 (rooted trees)
- **State transitions**: Deterministic transformation matrices
- **Energy flows**: Conservation and transformation equations
- **Geometric symmetries**: Tetrahedral and enneagram rotations

## Applications

This framework has been applied to:
- **Neural Networks** (cosys-xnn): Cognitive function and brain regions
- **Organizations** (cosys-org): Business structure and enterprise ecosystems
- **Reservoir Computing** (cosys-esn): Echo state networks and membrane computing
- **Cell Biology** (cosys-cell): Eukaryotic cells and organelles
- **Integumentary System** (cosys-skin): Multi-scale skin models
